                                <p>The Cauvery Resorts is touted to be a haven for ornithologists and bird-lovers alike.
                                    Whether you are expert at bird behaviour or just a plain novice who admires the
                                    beauty of his feathered friends.The resort is the best place to explore and get in
                                    touch with various creatures of flight. The Indian sub-continent accounts for over
                                    2060 species of birds, and the fact is that Coorg or Kodagu contributes as much as
                                    25% of the overall bird population in this regard, which is a matter or joy and
                                    pride for the tiny hill-station. The area is considered the best place to spot
                                    several species of birds, including some that have Coorg as their origin like
                                    Malabar Trogons, Nilgiri Laughing-Thrushes, Great Black Woodpeckers, and Malabar
                                    Whistling-Thrushes.Other varieties of birds include Yellow Browed Bulbuls, Pacific
                                    Swallows, Grasshopper Warblers, Orphean Warblers and Yellow Billed Babblers. Great
                                    Pied Hornbills, Nilgiri Wood Pigeons, Wynaad and Grey-Breasted Laughing Thrushes,
                                    Blue-Winged Parakeets, Grey-Headed Bulbuls, White-Bellied Treepies, the Nilgiri and
                                    White-Bellied Blue Flycatchers, Black Eagle and Ceylon Frogmouths comprise the rest
                                    of the species of birds that hail from the Coorg district.Apart from normal birds,
                                    Coorg also has several species of Owls including Short Eared and Oriental Scops Owls
                                    which can often be seen after nightfall.Embark on a guided bird watching trail in
