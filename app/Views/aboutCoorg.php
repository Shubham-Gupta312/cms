                                    He also built a palace inside the fort. It was eventually rebuilt in granite by Tipu

                                    Sultan who named the site as Jaffarabad. In 1790, Doddavira Rajendra took control of

                                    the fort. The palace was renovated by Lingarajendra Wodeyar II in 1812-1814. The

                                <h4>Nagarhole National park</h4>

                                <p>Derives its name from the combination of two Kannada words. 'Nagar,' meaning snake,
                                    and 'hole,' meaning streams. True to its name, quite a few serpentine streams fork
                                    through the rich tropical forests of the park. Nagarhole Park was set up in 1955. In
                                    1975, its area was increased to include a greater expanse of forest reserve. The
                                    original forest was once an exclusive hunting ground for the erstwhile Maharajas of
                                    Mysore. The park has been recently renamed as Rajiv Gandhi National Park after the
                                    late Prime Minister of India.</p>
